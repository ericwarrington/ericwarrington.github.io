			<h1>Beyond the Tales</h1>
			<p>Project Dates: March - October 2015</p>
			<p>Team Size: 5</p>
			<p>Language: C# (using Unity engine)</p>
			
			<h2>Summary</h2>
			<p>Inspired by the early Final Fantasy and Zelda games, <i>Beyond the Tales</i> is a 2D JRPG centered around a young man named Joreld. Raised and trained in the way of the Knight by his father, a retired Knight Commander of the kingdom of Cairnmount, Joreld comes home one day and finds that his world is going to change forever.</p>
			<p>I worked on this project with a group of my friends while in school.  We had two teams, Development and Story; I served on the Dev team. One of the devs also produced original scores for the game. We used the Unity game engine and wrote our own RPG engine--on top of it--from scratch.</p>
			
			<h2>Responsibilities</h2>
			<p>The Development team was responsible for:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Acquiring tilesets and other graphical assets (most were open-license)</li>
				<li>Designing and building maps</li>
				<li>The entire game engine: battles, NPCs, talking, scripts, maps, map-warps, etc.</li>
				<li>Designing/creating enemies, items, etc.</li>
				<li>Designing and building the UI</li>
				<li>Handling save data</li>
				<li>Anything else that required programming</li>
			</ul>
			
			<p>The Story team was responsible for:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Writing/creating all the story elements</li>
				<li>Designing story-NPCs (dialogue)</li>
				<li>Any requisite world-building</li>
				<li>Any other story-related tasks</li>
			</ul>
			
			<h2>Personal Responsibilities</h2>
			<p>As a Game Developer on Beyond the Tales' Development team, I did a good portion of the research involved for finding map tilesets and enemy graphics. I also designed and implemented the process we used for warping between maps--this was mostly based off my experience making ROM hacks for 3rd-gen Pok&eacute;mon games. I did a little bit of work on map designs and creation--some map editing, too--but most of our maps were simple and didn't necessarily follow good level design conventions. Finally, I was responsible for the saving/loading features. This required creating a "save data" data-structure and binary-serializing/deserializing it as necessary. The save data included map warp data (what map the player was on) and event flags (what story events had already ocurred). I also updated the menu logic to call the correct save/load methods, handle cases when no saves existed, and handle playing new games even when a previous save existed.</p>
